# Dapper-Dasher

Is a prototype endless 2D scroller built using C++ and the raylib library where the player has to avoid the nebulas as they are being drawn on the screen.

The player wins after they avoid all the enemies and loses if an enemy touches the player.

The player controls the main character using the spacebar key to jump and avoid the enemies.

This prototype is still under development. 

Things to add in the future:
- Score
- Enemy counter
- Menus
- Enemy position variation to avoid repetition
